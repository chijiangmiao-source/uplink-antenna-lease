"""Lease acquisition domain logic.

Concurrency design (all inside one READ COMMITTED transaction):

1. ``pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(:key))``
   Transactions that carry the same idempotency key are serialised, so a lost
   response followed by a retry can never create a second lease.
2. Look up the stored idempotency record. Same parameters -> replay the
   original token/expiry; different parameters -> stable ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT``.
3. ``SELECT ... FROM antennas WHERE id = :antenna_id FOR UPDATE``
   Serialises every contender for the same antenna. Unknown antenna raises
   ``ANTENNA_NOT_FOUND`` before any row is written.
4. Look up an active lease with
   ``released_at IS NULL AND expires_at > clock_timestamp()``. A lease
   whose ``expires_at`` has been reached (``expires_at <= clock_timestamp()``)
   is gone: the boundary belongs to the new request. A lease released early
   is also immediately available for handover.
5. Under the antenna lock, increment the antenna's
   ``last_control_generation`` and insert the new lease
   (``expires_at = clock_timestamp() + make_interval``) stamped with that
   value, plus its idempotency record, then commit atomically. The
   generation is a per-antenna monotonically increasing epoch that lets a
   device reject commands from a stale controller after a network partition;
   every rejection path happens before the counter is bumped, so failed
   attempts never consume a generation.

Progress reporting, early release and renewal take the same antenna row lock
as lease acquisition. Every timestamp originates from PostgreSQL; the host
clock is never read.

Dual-site bundles (``acquire_lease_bundle``) follow the same model but lock
both antenna rows in ascending id order and sample ``clock_timestamp()``
once, so the two member leases are granted atomically with identical
timestamps and reversed-order concurrent requests serialise instead of
deadlocking.

    1. ``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` serialises transactions sharing the
       renewal idempotency key, so a lost response followed by a retry can
       never extend twice.
    2. The token must identify an existing lease; unknown tokens raise
       ``LEASE_NOT_FOUND``. The idempotency record is then checked and a
       same-key/same-params hit REPLAYS the first renewal's boundary with
       ``replay: True``; same key with other params is a stable
       ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT``. Neither path writes.
    3. ``SELECT ... FROM antennas ... FOR UPDATE`` takes the antenna row
       lock, identical to acquisition, progress and release. Renewal is
       therefore serialised against expiry hand-over: at the boundary only
       the renewal or the new acquisition can win.
    4. The lease is re-read AFTER the lock and checked against the database
       clock: released or expired (``expires_at <= clock_timestamp()``)
       tokens raise ``LEASE_EXPIRED`` without any write, so a rejection can
       never touch a successor holder.
    5. The extension stacks onto the CURRENT (possibly already renewed)
       expiry: ``new_expires_at = expires_at + make_interval(extra)``. The
       lease UPDATE, the renewal history row and the idempotency record are
