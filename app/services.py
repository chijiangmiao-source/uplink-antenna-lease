"""Lease acquisition domain logic.

Concurrency design (all inside one READ COMMITTED transaction):

1. ``pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(:key))``
   Transactions that carry the same idempotency key are serialised, so a lost
   response followed by a retry can never create a second lease.
2. Look up the stored idempotency record. Same parameters -> replay the
   original token/expiry; different parameters -> stable ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT``.
3. ``SELECT ... FROM antennas WHERE id = :antenna_id FOR UPDATE``
   Serialises every contender for the same antenna. Unknown antenna raises
   ``ANTENNA_NOT_FOUND`` before any row is written.
4. Look up an active lease with
   ``released_at IS NULL AND expires_at > clock_timestamp()``. A lease
   whose ``expires_at`` has been reached (``expires_at <= clock_timestamp()``)
   is gone: the boundary belongs to the new request. A lease released early
   is also immediately available for handover.
5. Insert the new lease (``expires_at = clock_timestamp() + make_interval``)
   and its idempotency record, then commit atomically.

Progress reporting and early release take the same antenna row lock as lease
acquisition. Every timestamp originates from PostgreSQL; the host clock is
never read.
